Topics: Array, Two Pointers, Binary Search, Sorting
Difficulty: Medium

My insights:
When there's a task to find all subsequences we can sort the array and find subsequences there. The result might be the same depending on the condition. This is the case, because the condition is about min and max, thats why subsequences are like subsets

It was not obvious in two pointers that if confition is valid, we should move only left pointer, but not the right one. See comment in code.
